# JCR6 CLI

These are the JCR6 CLI in Go.
Please note, everything is still in a very early development stage. Many things may not yet work at all.
Everything has been set up to be compatible with the original BlitzMax tools though.
Once everything is done here, it might be possible the original BlitzMax CLI tools will be deprecated
although some emergency maintenance may still be performed on them if required.

In this source not all .go conventions are completely followed by the rules. That is why I created the "compileme.sh" script for unix based systems and "compileme.bat" for Windows.
Also make sure that all requiments as described in the txt/preinst.txt file are followed

When stuff is ready some ready to go archives will of course be released. Very likely for Mac, Linux and Windows
