**** BEFORE WE BEGIN ****

This compilation process requires the following things to be done prior to compiling.

- First of all, Go must be installed
- On Windows you must make sure the Go compiler can be reached through
  the PATH environment variable. On unix based systems such as Mac and
  Linux this should have been done by default.
- Make sure the directory this source is in located in a folder reachable
  through the GOPATH environment
- On unix systems this variable is not exported by this script. Do it
  yourself prior to running it.
- Make sure this repository is cloned into an src/trickyunits from
  the GOPATH https://github.com/Tricky1975/trickyunits_go
  Don't use "GO GET" for that, but "GIT CLONE".
- From GitHub you'll also need itchio/lzma, you can just "GO GET" 
  that repo. If you do not want that just put "//" before
  "trickyunits/jcr6/jcr6lzma" line in the genimps.go file
- From Github you'll also need ulikunitz/xz. you can just "GO GET"
  that repo. If you don't want that just put "//" before
  "trickyunits/jcr6/jcr6xz" in the genimps.go file

Be sure you got all this in order, or the compiling will fail
